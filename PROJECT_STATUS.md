## 1. Current stage

**NEXT EPIC DECISION / MASTER REMAINING WORK INVENTORY PREPARED /
USER DECISION REQUIRED**.

There is no active Codex Goal. No implementation epic is selected or recorded as `NEXT`.
The canonical catalog and comparative shortlist are in
[`docs/UPDATED_PRODUCT_AI_ROADMAP.md`](docs/UPDATED_PRODUCT_AI_ROADMAP.md#13-master-remaining-work-inventory).

## 2. Release closure

**PLATFORM & VENUE ONBOARDING / OWNERSHIP COCKPIT / DONE / MVP /
STAGING-SMOKE-PASSED**.

Release HEAD `e35def99ea8429462e5fdaaeee914f57da72e775` matches `origin/main`.
The user confirmed fully green GitHub Actions for that HEAD, staging deploy, the consolidated
onboarding/ownership smoke and cleanup. Local GitHub CLI authentication is invalid, so Actions are
recorded as user-confirmed rather than independently queried in this docs-only closure.

Recorded smoke outcomes:

- first applicant submitted through Telegram; an existing Owner submitted an additional venue in
  Venue Mini App;
- exact retry created no duplicate request; a different application created a separate request;
- Platform Owner saw requests, venues and owners;
- create/link produced exactly one venue and active OWNER membership;
- selected venue did not change automatically;
- the legacy quota-direct entry used the shared application flow;
- multi-owner venues and owner portfolios worked;
- a first-ever applicant account received baseline limit `1`;
- applicant, actor and source remained server-derived;
- cleanup passed.

This closes only the bounded onboarding/ownership release, not the whole Platform/Venue product or
overall production readiness.

## 3. Remaining-work audit snapshot

- Markdown surfaces scanned: `35` (`32` under `docs/**` plus this file, `README.md`, root
  `AGENTS.md`).
- Normalized raw candidate records: `195`.
- Canonical remaining items after evidence review and global deduplication: `107`.
- Disposition: `OPEN_CONFIRMED 43`, `BLOCKED_PRODUCT_DECISION 14`,
  `BLOCKED_PREREQUISITE 13`, `DEFERRED_AFTER_MVP 31`, `UNKNOWN_NEEDS_RESEARCH 6`,
  `STALE_ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED 42`, `DUPLICATE_OF_OTHER_ID 35`, `HISTORICAL_ONLY 11`.
- Historical audits remain evidence/history and do not reactivate closed work without current
  code/test evidence.

Current P2/P3 registry entries preserved as open:

- `ONBOARDING-H2-001`;
- `ONBOARDING-TG-CONFIRM-001`;
- `ONBOARDING-DECISION-RETRY-001`;
- `MENU-CONC-001`;
- `MENU-TEST-002`.

Media/object-storage work remains blocked by `MEDIA-STORAGE-DECISION-001`; this docs-only task did
not implement or modify Media/R2. The next epic remains a joint user/ChatGPT decision after review
of the full master inventory.
