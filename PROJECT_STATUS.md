## 1. Current stage

**V125 STAGING TELEGRAM TRAFFIC ALLOWLIST PREREQUISITE / FEATURE-WORKTREE IMPLEMENTED /
LOCAL VALIDATION COMPLETE / INDEPENDENT REVIEW REQUIRED**.

The prerequisite is being implemented only on the V125-compatible feature worktree based on exact
SHA `e7aed9cdc243a7be158841a00d214716c21beb94`. It adds a centralized fail-closed staging identity
policy across Telegram ingress, Mini App auth and protected JWT requests, outbox claim and direct
chat-targeted calls, plus restricted operator/configuration documentation. It contains no database
migration or Mini App frontend change. This status does not record review, commit, push, GitHub
Actions, V125 staging deploy, manual Telegram/Mini App smoke, backup, V126 or any staging/runtime/data
change. The focused policy/config/lifecycle, webhook/inbound, Mini App auth/session/RBAC,
outbox/staff-notification and complete Telegram Router suites pass, as do `compileKotlin` and
`ktlintCheck`. The final comparable full backend suite executed 2080 tests with zero errors and zero
skips and reported exactly five confirmed V125 baseline failures: three in
`GuestBookingRepositoryTest` and two in `StaffProfileLinkConcurrencyPostgresTest`. The failure set,
expected/actual values and assertion lines match the recorded exact-V125 baseline. This is local
evidence only; independent review, commit, push, green
Actions and a separately authorized V125 staging phase remain outstanding.

The independent booking release line below remains unchanged context and is not part of this
V125-compatible prerequisite branch.

**BOOKING CONVERSATION INTEGRITY / THREAD UNIQUENESS AND REAL MULTI-TENANT ISOLATION /
MVP IMPLEMENTED / LOCAL VALIDATION PASSED / REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE COMMIT**.

This bounded fix records local implementation and test evidence for
`BOOKING-CLIENT-ID-RELOAD-RECONCILIATION-001`,
`BOOKING-AUDIT-UNKNOWN-REFERENCE-KEY-001`,
`BOOKING-MINIAPP-IDEMPOTENCY-PG-EVIDENCE-001`, `BOOKING-DOC-PREVERDICT-001`,
`BOOKING-OUTBOX-LEGACY-DEDUPE-SEMANTICS-001` and
`BOOKING-MESSAGE-MIGRATION-METADATA-001`, plus the H2 semantic-parity fix for
`BOOKING-DEDUP-AUDIT-REF-001`, inside only
`BOOKING-THREAD-UNIQUENESS-001` / `QA-BOOKING-ISOLATION-001`. The four Guest/Venue dedicated/generic
Mini App booking surfaces now reconcile every authoritative booking id through a complete bounded
read-only batch contract before exposing first-send/reply actions after recreate; absence from a
capped thread list is never evidence of no thread, and a failed/partial read remains screen-scoped
and fail-closed.
PostgreSQL V124/H2 V125 reject recursive unknown audit reference keys before domain mutation, the
deployment preflight uses the same predicate, and Mini App message metadata is asserted exactly on
both databases. Legacy outbox enqueue retains key-only replay while only the connection-aware
booking API uses strict canonical-envelope collision checks. Real PostgreSQL evidence observes the
waiting caller's exact independent PID, ungranted `pg_locks` row and
`pg_blocking_pids(waiter) = [caller A]` before release/commit. Independent review is still required;
no final-review verdict, green Actions, preflight, migration, deploy or staging smoke is recorded.
No reminder, no-show, queue, preorder or broad analytics/audit redesign is included.

`BOOKING-V124-CATALOG-INVENTORY-001` is also locally fixed: PostgreSQL V124 now anchors inbound
foreign keys on the exact current-schema `support_threads` OID and records one authoritative row per
constraint through `pg_catalog`, including exact source OID/namespace, complete ordered
`conkey`/`confkey` arrays and action/match metadata. Exact current-schema source OIDs and attnums are
required for the two known single-column references; composite, non-`id`, external same-name,
additional cross-schema and privilege-hidden cross-owner references fail closed before domain
mutation. A controlled PostgreSQL 16 catalog stress reproduced SQLSTATE `57014` at V124's
five-minute statement timeout before the fix. The strengthened production-migration wrapper passes
`47/47` with domain/catalog/index/Flyway-history snapshots, and the exact `44/44` menu mutation class
remains the bounded performance evidence. This local fix still requires a short independent review,
an explicit commit and a new green Actions run before any preflight, migration or deploy; no staging
preflight/deploy or post-failure release-DB migration has been performed.

## 2. Release closure

**PLATFORM & VENUE ONBOARDING / OWNERSHIP COCKPIT / DONE / MVP /
STAGING-SMOKE-PASSED**.

Release HEAD `e35def99ea8429462e5fdaaeee914f57da72e775` matches `origin/main`.
The user confirmed fully green GitHub Actions for that HEAD, staging deploy, the consolidated
onboarding/ownership smoke and cleanup. Local GitHub CLI authentication is invalid, so Actions are
recorded as user-confirmed rather than independently queried in this docs-only closure.

Recorded smoke outcomes:

- first applicant submitted through Telegram; an existing Owner submitted an additional venue in
  Venue Mini App;
- exact retry created no duplicate request; a different application created a separate request;
- Platform Owner saw requests, venues and owners;
- create/link produced exactly one venue and active OWNER membership;
- selected venue did not change automatically;
- the legacy quota-direct entry used the shared application flow;
- multi-owner venues and owner portfolios worked;
- a first-ever applicant account received baseline limit `1`;
- applicant, actor and source remained server-derived;
- cleanup passed.

This closes only the bounded onboarding/ownership release, not the whole Platform/Venue product or
overall production readiness.

## 3. Remaining-work audit snapshot

- Markdown surfaces scanned: `35` (`32` under `docs/**` plus this file, `README.md`, root
  `AGENTS.md`).
- Normalized raw candidate records: `195`.
- Canonical catalog items after evidence review and global deduplication: `107`; `105` remain active
  after the two locally implemented booking items below.
- Disposition: `OPEN_CONFIRMED 41`, `MVP_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VALIDATION_PASSED 2`, `BLOCKED_PRODUCT_DECISION 14`,
  `BLOCKED_PREREQUISITE 13`, `DEFERRED_AFTER_MVP 31`, `UNKNOWN_NEEDS_RESEARCH 6`,
  `STALE_ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED 42`, `DUPLICATE_OF_OTHER_ID 35`, `HISTORICAL_ONLY 11`.
- Historical audits remain evidence/history and do not reactivate closed work without current
  code/test evidence.

Current P2/P3 registry entries preserved as open:

- `ONBOARDING-H2-001`;
- `ONBOARDING-TG-CONFIRM-001`;
- `ONBOARDING-DECISION-RETRY-001`;
- `MENU-CONC-001`;
- `MENU-TEST-002`.

Booking review registry for this Goal:

- `BOOKING-DEDUP-READ-001` — `DONE` after fail-closed H2/PostgreSQL lossless-read migration proof and
  live writer-first/migration-first snapshot serialization;
- `BOOKING-WRITER-CONVERGENCE-001` — `DONE` after production route/repository convergence proof;
- `BOOKING-CI-FLOOR-001` — `DONE` after exact selectors, XML minima and structured Playwright floor;
- `BOOKING-PG-EVIDENCE-001` — `DONE` after exact PostgreSQL race post-state evidence;
- `BOOKING-MINIAPP-OUTBOX-001` — `DONE`; persisted scope-bound Mini App replay identity and
  same-transaction message/thread/strict-booking outbox remain covered; the legacy enqueue contract
  is separately preserved by this bounded fix;
- `BOOKING-DEDUP-AUDIT-REF-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`; H2 now validates and remaps the exact
  top-level integer `ticketId` with a duplicate-aware semantic JSON helper independent of key order
  and formatting. The recursive unknown-key gap is locally fixed separately under
  `BOOKING-AUDIT-UNKNOWN-REFERENCE-KEY-001`; both still await independent review;
- `BOOKING-MIGRATION-SNAPSHOT-001` — `DONE`; pre-guard PostgreSQL table locks and real writer-first
  plus migration-first Flyway serialization pass the exact `2/2` concurrency gate;
- `BOOKING-READ-LOCK-ORDER-001` — `DONE`; all 15 standalone read-marker callers and four connection-aware paths
  use `bookings -> support_threads -> support_thread_reads` or
  `support_threads -> support_thread_reads`, with fresh repository `11/11` and real PostgreSQL
  `3/3` lock/RBAC evidence and no reverse runtime DML path;
- `BOOKING-SAVEPOINT-COLLISION-001` — `OPEN`; the current unique-conflict branch is defensive-only
  under the booking-row lock and requires a separate review before removal.

Findings fixed locally and still requiring independent review in this bounded fix:

- `BOOKING-CLIENT-ID-RELOAD-RECONCILIATION-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`;
- `BOOKING-AUDIT-UNKNOWN-REFERENCE-KEY-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`;
- `BOOKING-MINIAPP-IDEMPOTENCY-PG-EVIDENCE-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`;
- `BOOKING-DOC-PREVERDICT-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`;
- `BOOKING-OUTBOX-LEGACY-DEDUPE-SEMANTICS-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`;
- `BOOKING-MESSAGE-MIGRATION-METADATA-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`;
- `BOOKING-DEDUP-AUDIT-REF-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- `BOOKING-V124-CATALOG-INVENTORY-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- `BOOKING-V124-CONSTRAINT-SHAPE-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- `BOOKING-V124-SOURCE-RELATION-IDENTITY-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- `BOOKING-V124-PG-CI-FLOOR-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- `BOOKING-V124-CROSS-OWNER-DOMAIN-SNAPSHOT-001` — `LOCAL_FIX_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

Still open by design:

- `BOOKING-CI-PLAYWRIGHT-FLAKE-001` — `OPEN`; an earlier structured run executed `197/198` after
  one unrelated favorite-test failure, and this pass first executed `205/206` after one unrelated
  catalog-debounce timing failure before the focused and second full `206/206` reruns passed.
  Trigger: the next Mini App CI-hardening pass or a repeated same failure in GitHub Actions;
- `BOOKING-SAVEPOINT-COLLISION-001` — `OPEN`;
- `BOOKING-AUDIT-EVENTS-001` — `OPEN`;
- `BOOKING-REMINDER-ROLLOUT-001` — `OPEN`;
- `BOOKING-NO-SHOW-AUTOMATION-001` — `OPEN`;
- `BOOKING-QUEUE-POLISH-001` — `OPEN`;
- `BOOKING-PREORDER-001` — `OPEN`.

Media/object-storage work remains blocked by `MEDIA-STORAGE-DECISION-001`; this Goal did not
implement or modify Media/R2. Next step: independent review, explicit commit, green Actions,
PostgreSQL pre-deploy scan/migration, then bounded Guest/Venue/Telegram staging isolation smoke.
